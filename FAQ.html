                        <h5>Do I have to go to Oxbridge/Ivy League to participate?</h5>
                        <p>In the past this has been one of the requirements of Chinese schools. Although our camps are
                          still advertised as having teachers from top US/UK universities, and the program is still
                          highly competitive in order to ensure the quality of education provided to Chinese students,
                          we welcome all applicants who meet the requirements listed above.</p>
                        <p><img src="./FAQ « ISEC_files/image7-401-e1452958067597.jpg" alt=""></p>
                        <h5>Where will we be teaching this year?</h5>
                        <p>In the past, camps have been held in Beijing, Hebei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Shandong, Liaoning,
                          Zhejiang, Inner Mongolia, Fujian, and Shanxi provinces. Actual locations vary each year.
                          Teachers are informed of exact details during Orientation.</p>
                        <h5>What are the qualities an ISEC teacher?</h5>
                        <ul>
                          <li>English fluency</li>
                          <li>Adaptability</li>
                          <li>A vibrant Christian faith</li>
                          <li>Enthusiasm for working with kids</li>
                          <li>Interest or experience in teaching</li>
                          <li>Cross cultural competency</li>
                          <li>Team players</li>
                          <li>Leadership</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Once I apply am I obliged to participate?</h5>
                        <p>Application does not imply any sort of commitment. However, once teachers have accepted our
                          offer of a place in the program, they are expected to participate in the entire ISEC Program.
                          See the <a href="http://daybreakasia.org/isec/schedule/">schedule</a> for this year’s program
                          dates. Late arrivals or early departures are only granted if ISEC leadership has given
                          permission, in writing, <em>before</em> the start of the summer.</p>
                        <p><img src="./FAQ « ISEC_files/image22-85-e1452958076672.jpg" alt=""></p>
                        <h5>What are the interviews like?</h5>
                        <p>Interviews are taken over Skype. They typically last 30 minutes, and will generally involve 2
                          interviewers who are themselves past participants.</p>
                        <h5>What happens after I’ve been accepted?</h5>
                        <p>We will help you prepare for the summer. Cross-cultural and English teaching instruction is
                          provided online and in person, and you will begin receiving instructions about visas, flights,
                          what to bring, and so on.</p>
                        <h5>What happens after the program?</h5>
                        <p>You are free to return home any time after <a
                            href="http://daybreakasia.org/isec/schedule">the last day of the program</a>; however, this
                          is a great opportunity to go travelling on your own account, or maybe even with some of your
                          new friends. This is essentially at your own discretion. You choose when to fly home, as long
                          as it’s <em>after</em> the last day of the program.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div style="width:440px; float:right">
                        <h5>Do I need any spoken/written Chinese ability?</h5>
                        <p>As all classes are conducted in English, with in-classroom translation provided by local
                          Chinese university students, teachers do not need to have any Chinese language ability.
                          However, teachers who are fluent in Mandarin Chinese are always a great asset, and we welcome
                          Mandarin-speakers to apply.</p>
                        <h5>What does the teaching involve? Do I need to have good knowledge of English grammar or prior
                          teacher training?</h5>
                        <p>ISEC employs the immersion English technique. Consequently, we aim to recreate a British or
                          American style camp in China, allowing Chinese students to have an authentic cultural
                          experience in their own country. Teachers are therefore not required to speak Chinese, or to
                          have had previous teaching experience (though both are beneficial). Teachers are expected to
                          prepare a series of around 10 lessons on a theme of their choice. Previous examples have
                          included topics such as art, history, stories, heroes, festivals, travel, music, explorers,
                          the weather. Lesson topics are, therefore, highly subject to the teachers own interests and
                          knowledge. After acceptance onto the program, teachers will receive information, guidelines
                          and past experience of how best to structure and present their lessons during pre-departure
                          training and on arrival during Orientation.</p>
                        <p><img src="./FAQ « ISEC_files/image21-82-e1452958085492.jpg" alt=""></p>
                        <h5>What is a typical day like?</h5>
                        <p>Please see <a href="http://daybreakasia.org/isec/a-day-in-the-life">A Day in the Life</a> for
                          examples of a typical day.</p>
                        <h5>What are the responsibilities of a Camp Director?</h5>
                        <p>Camp Directors manage the day-to-day operations of the camp and manage relationships with all
                          relevant parties to ensure the successful operation of the camps. Directors liason between the
                          ISEC leadership, camp managers, teachers, Chinese coteachers, and local representatives. They
                          care for the needs of the teaching team, and oversee operational details of the camp as a
                          whole.&nbsp;Directors play a big role as the leaders of the teaching team, and are
                          responsible, with support from ISEC leadership, for the overall well-being of the teachers.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Can I fundraise to help cover the cost of my ticket?</h5>
                        <p>Absolutely!&nbsp;We encourage participants to not only raise funds, but to raise awareness
                          and support of your trip with your friends, family, and local network. The best way to support
                          an individual teacher is through our <a
                            href="http://daybreakasia.org/isec/donations">donations page</a>, where you can specify the
                          name of the teacher you wish to support. Daybreak:Asia will reimburse the participant with all
                          donations up to the cost of their flights (purchased, not redeemed from frequent-flier miles),
                          visas, and travel insurance at the end of the program upon receiving a digital receipt.
                          Daybreak:Asia reserves the right to retain donated monies that exceed the listed price of your
                          ticket. For more information, visit our <a
